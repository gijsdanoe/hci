How to use:

Part 1:

Click on the update button to set your filters (a term and a language in code e.g. 'en' or 'nl').
Please wait as during this time it creates a txt file and a pickle file with the filtered tweets.
After waiting a few seconds, press update to see the tweets. If you wish to see more, you can press update multiple times.

Part 2:

Click 'File - Open' to open your desired pickle file (we've included one already just in case). It will display.
You can filter it by sentiment (whether the conversation turns positive, negative or stays neutral), the length of the conversation and the number of unique users. You can set a minimum and maximum.
Press 'Filter'.s
